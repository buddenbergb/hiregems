          <h4>Web Site Security</h4>
          <p>At HRgems, Inc, we strive to safeguard your online security. All information provided by customers visiting our web site is kept strictly confidential, to prevent the unauthorized use of the information. All the nonpublic personal information we receive from our customers at HRgems, Inc, whether via phone, mail or the internet, is treated confidentially, as outlined in our privacy policy.</p>
          <h5>SSL Certificate</h5>
          <p>HRgems, Inc is protected by an SSL Certificate issued by Network Solutions, a trusted internet innovator for over 10 years. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, which is the standard security technology for creating an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remains private and secure. All Secure Link SSL certificates from Network Solutions are encrypted at 128 bits, which is the highest encryption level available. Your will know you have created an SSL link with our web server during the checkout process by seeing the "https://" at the beginning of the URL, as well as seeing the padlock icon (available in most but not all browsers) in the lower right-hand frame of your Web browser.</p>
          <h5>Powerful 128-bit Encryption</h5>
          <p>128-bit encryption means that the data cryptographically encoded during an SSL session is at the highest level currently available, and nearly impossible to break. Compared to a 40-bit encrypted SSL certificate, a 128-bit is more than 300 septillion (300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) times stronger. All Secure Link SSL certificates from Network Solutions are encrypted at 128 bits.</p>
          <h5>E-Mail Security</h5>
          <p>Regular internet e-mail is never completely secure. When corresponding to us via e-mail, you should only provide information that is non-sensitive and non-confidential. Please do not furnish us any information of a personal nature that you feel uncomfortable providing to us via e-mail.
